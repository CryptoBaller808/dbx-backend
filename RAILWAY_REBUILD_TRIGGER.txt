RAILWAY REBUILD TRIGGER - DOCKER STARTUP FIX
Timestamp: 2025-10-11T06:50:00Z
Issue: App not starting - no port binding
Fix: Added immediate [BOOT] logging at top of server.js
Dockerfile: Verified WORKDIR /app and CMD ["node","server.js"]
Package.json: Verified "start": "node server.js"
Action: Force rebuild with clear build cache
Expected: [BOOT] Starting DBX backend build logs should appear before healthcheck
