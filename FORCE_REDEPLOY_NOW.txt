Issue: Railway not deploying latest health route fixes
Evidence: 
- /live-check works (server.js running)
- /_routes returns 404 (new routes not deployed)
- /health returns old {"ok":true,"ts":"..."} format
- Expected: {"service":"price","status":"ok","commit":"...","providers":{...},"fallbackTiers":[...]}
Action: Force complete rebuild and deployment
