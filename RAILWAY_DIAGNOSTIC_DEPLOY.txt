RAILWAY DIAGNOSTIC DEPLOYMENT - DEFINITIVE HEALTH ROUTE FIX
Timestamp: 2025-10-11T08:00:00Z

CHANGES MADE:
1. Added X-Health-Handler: server.js:new header to /health endpoint
2. Added Cache-Control: no-store to /health and /_routes endpoints  
3. Enhanced boot logging: [BOOT] server.js mounted /health FIRST
4. Enhanced boot logging: [BOOT] commit=SHA node=version port=PORT

PROJECT STRUCTURE VERIFIED:
- Root Directory: /home/ubuntu/dbx-backend (contains server.js, package.json, Dockerfile)
- Start Command: node server.js (verified in package.json)
- Monorepo: Detected (dbx-backend and dbx-frontend folders)

RAILWAY SERVICE SETTINGS REQUIRED:
- Root Directory: Should point to backend folder (not repo root)
- Start Command: node server.js
- Healthcheck Path: /live-check (temporarily, switch to /health after verification)
- Clear Build Cache: ENABLED

EXPECTED HEADERS:
- X-Health-Handler: server.js:new (proves new handler active)
- Cache-Control: no-store (prevents caching issues)

DIAGNOSTIC ENDPOINTS:
- /_routes: Shows route registration order
- /health-fix-test: Deployment verification
- /live-check: Known working endpoint
